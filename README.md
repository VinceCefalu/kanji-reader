# kanji-reader
 A reupload of a university project I did with a friend of mine. An app that helps students of Japanese practice reading kanji. In Japanese if you don't know a kanji, it's very difficult and sometimes impossible to guess how it actually sounds or what it means. Therefore, this app will provide the phonetic reading of kanji (and by extension, words) that they don't know, which will enable them to read through a text (which can be inserted by the user), try to guess the meaning or look it up, and then be able to commit that to memory easier since the sounds are known.
 
 I won't be updating this anymore, since this method no longer fits my beliefs on how to learn a language. However, my friend and I are still quite proud of what we accomplished in this.
